# Cross-Sums
AutoHotkey project to calculate all the combinations of numeric options for the crossword style summing game.

Number combinations must be: 
* integers 1-9 (no zeros)
* non-repeating
* more than one digit (less than 9)

# Background
I bought my first copy of a Dell Solver's Choice Variety Puzzle while boarding a flight. I've been addicted ever since and this particular game has really go my programming brain tingling.  I'm sure there are other, more efficient solutions.  But this one is mine.
